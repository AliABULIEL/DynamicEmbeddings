1. The Core Idea
What You're Building
You're creating a system that generates context-aware embeddings by intelligently combining multiple specialized models based on the domain(s) present in the text.
The Problem It Solves
Traditional approaches use either:

General embeddings (BERT): Good overall but miss domain-specific nuances
Domain-specific embeddings (BioBERT): Excellent for their domain but poor for others

Your approach says: "Why choose? Let's use ALL of them and combine them intelligently!"
The Innovation
Traditional: Text → Single Model → Embedding
Your Method: Text → Domain Detection → Multiple Models → Weighted Combination → Better Embedding
Real Example
Consider the text: "The FDA approved the new cancer drug after Phase 3 trials showed 85% efficacy"

General BERT: Understands it's about approval and trials
BioBERT: Deeply understands "Phase 3 trials", "efficacy", clinical context
Legal-BERT: Understands "FDA approved", regulatory aspects
Your Method: Combines both medical (60%) and legal (20%) and general (20%) understanding


2. Why This Approach Makes Sense
Theoretical Foundation

Mixture of Experts: Well-established principle that specialized models combined outperform generalists
Ensemble Learning: Multiple models reduce individual model biases
Domain Adaptation: Leveraging domain knowledge improves performance
Soft Classification: Real text often spans multiple domains (not binary)

Practical Advantages

No Training Required: Uses existing pre-trained models
Interpretable: You can see which domains contribute
Flexible: Easy to add/remove domains
Efficient: Only inference, no training costs

Key Design Decisions

Zero-Shot Classification: No need to train a domain classifier
Pre-trained Everything: Focus on composition, not training
Modular Architecture: Each component is independent
Multiple Composition Methods: Test different ways to combine


4. Detailed Component Breakdown
Component 1: Domain Classifier
Purpose: Determine what percentage of each domain is in the text
How it works:
python# Uses Facebook's BART-MNLI model (trained on 1M+ examples)
# Zero-shot = classifies without seeing examples of our specific domains

Input: "COVID vaccine shows promising results"
Process:
  - Model asks: "Is this about scientific?" → 30% yes
  - Model asks: "Is this about medical?" → 70% yes
  - Model asks: "Is this about legal?" → 0% yes
Output: [0.3, 0.0, 0.7, 0.0, 0.0]  # [sci, news, med, legal, social]
Why BART-MNLI?

Trained on Natural Language Inference (NLI)
Can determine if text belongs to unseen categories
No training needed for new domains

Component 2: Domain Embedders
Purpose: Generate specialized embeddings from each domain model
The 5 Models:

SciBERT (Scientific)

Trained on: 1.14M scientific papers
Understands: Research methodology, scientific terms
Example strength: "p-value", "hypothesis", "correlation"


BioBERT (Medical)

Trained on: PubMed abstracts + PMC articles
Understands: Medical terminology, drug names, symptoms
Example strength: "myocardial infarction", "antibody", "pathogenesis"


Legal-BERT (Legal)

Trained on: Legal documents, court cases
Understands: Legal terminology, precedents
Example strength: "jurisdiction", "plaintiff", "statutory"


BERTweet (Social Media)

Trained on: 850M tweets
Understands: Informal language, hashtags, abbreviations
Example strength: "LOL", "#trending", "@mentions"


MPNet (News - proxy)

Trained on: General + news-like text
Understands: Current events, reporting style
Example strength: "Breaking news", "sources say", "reportedly"



Each model outputs: 768-dimensional vector (same size, crucial for combination)
Component 3: Embedding Composer
Purpose: Combine multiple embeddings into one
Composition Methods:

Weighted Sum (Primary):

pythonfinal = 0.3*SciBERT + 0.0*NewsBERT + 0.7*BioBERT + ...
# Weights come from domain classifier probabilities

Attention-Based:

python# Uses attention mechanism to weight embeddings
# Can capture interactions between domains

Max Pooling:

python# Takes maximum value across each dimension
# Good for preserving strongest signals

Learned Gate:

python# Applies threshold before weighting
# Filters out low-confidence domains
Component 4: Evaluator
Purpose: Test if composed embeddings are better than baselines
Evaluation Tasks:

Classification (AG News, DBPedia)

Tests if embeddings preserve categorical information
Metric: Accuracy


Semantic Similarity (STS-B)

Tests if embeddings preserve meaning relationships
Metric: Spearman/Pearson correlation


Ablation Studies

Tests which composition method works best
Tests impact of each component




5. Implementation Flow
Phase 1: Setup (What happens when you initialize)
python# When you run: composer = EmbeddingComposer()

1. Load zero-shot classifier (BART-MNLI)
2. Load 5 domain models into memory
3. Set up composition functions
4. Initialize logging
Phase 2: Processing Single Text
python# When you run: embedding = composer.compose("Medical breakthrough announced")

1. Domain Classification:
   - Text → Tokenize → BART-MNLI → Probabilities
   - Output: [0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0]

2. Generate All Embeddings:
   - Text → SciBERT → E1 (768-dim)
   - Text → NewsBERT → E2 (768-dim)
   - Text → BioBERT → E3 (768-dim)
   - Text → LegalBERT → E4 (768-dim)
   - Text → BERTweet → E5 (768-dim)

3. Compose:
   - Final = 0.2*E1 + 0.3*E2 + 0.5*E3 + 0.0*E4 + 0.0*E5
   - Output: Single 768-dim vector
Phase 3: Batch Processing (For experiments)
python# When evaluating on datasets

1. Load dataset (e.g., 1000 texts from AG News)
2. For each text:
   - Get domain probabilities (batched for efficiency)
   - Get embeddings from all models
   - Compose using selected method
3. Train classifier on composed embeddings
4. Evaluate using cross-validation
5. Compare with baselines

    }
    ...
}
Why: Easy to swap models or add new domains
Core Model Files
src/models/domain_classifier.py
Class: DomainClassifier
Key Methods:

__init__: Loads BART-MNLI model
classify(text): Returns probability distribution
classify_batch(texts): Efficient batch processing
get_dominant_domain(text): Returns highest probability domain

Technical Details:
python# Zero-shot magic happens here:
result = self.classifier(
    text,
    candidate_labels=['scientific', 'medical', ...],
    hypothesis_template="This text is about {}."
)
# BART-MNLI treats this as:
# "Is 'This text is about medical' true given the text?"
src/models/domain_embedders.py
Classes:

TransformerEmbedder: Wrapper for regular transformers
DomainEmbedderManager: Manages all 5 models

Key Innovation: Unified interface for different model types
python# Some models are sentence-transformers (easy)
model = SentenceTransformer('model-name')
embedding = model.encode(text)

# Others are regular transformers (need wrapping)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('model-name')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('model-name')
# ... tokenize, forward pass, mean pooling ...
Memory Management:

Option to load models on-demand vs all at once
GPU detection and allocation
Batch processing for efficiency

src/models/embedding_composer.py
Class: EmbeddingComposer
The Heart of Your Innovation
Composition Methods Explained:

Weighted Sum:

python# Simple but effective
for i, domain in enumerate(domains):
    final += probability[i] * embedding[domain]

Attention-Based:

python# More sophisticated
# Could learn which domains interact well
attention_scores = softmax(query @ keys)
final = attention_scores @ values

Max Pooling:

python# Preserves strongest signals
# Good when one domain dominates
final = max(all_embeddings, axis=0)

Learned Gate:

python# Filters noise
if probability > threshold:
    include in combination
else:
    ignore
Data Handling
src/data/dataset_loader.py
Purpose: Standardizes dataset loading
Handles Different Formats:
python# AG News: Simple text + label

7. How Everything Works Together
Data Flow Example
Let's trace one text through the entire system:
Input: "The Supreme Court ruled that tech companies must protect user privacy"
Step 1: Domain Classification
Text → Tokenizer → BART-MNLI
Output: [0.1, 0.2, 0.0, 0.6, 0.1]
        (sci, news, med, legal, social)
Step 2: Generate Embeddings
Text → SciBERT → [0.23, -0.45, 0.67, ...] (768 values)
Text → NewsBERT → [0.31, -0.22, 0.55, ...]
Text → BioBERT → [0.18, -0.33, 0.44, ...]
Text → LegalBERT → [0.42, -0.18, 0.73, ...]
Text → BERTweet → [0.15, -0.51, 0.38, ...]
Step 3: Compose
Final = 0.1*SciBERT + 0.2*NewsBERT + 0.0*BioBERT + 0.6*LegalBERT + 0.1*BERTweet
     = [0.35, -0.24, 0.65, ...]
Step 4: Use for Task
Classification: Embedding → LogisticRegression → Class prediction
Similarity: Embedding1, Embedding2 → Cosine → Similarity score
Error Handling
The system handles various failure modes:

Model Download Failures: Falls back to available models
GPU Memory: Automatically uses CPU if GPU fails
Batch Size: Adjusts if memory insufficient
Missing Datasets: Skips and continues with others
