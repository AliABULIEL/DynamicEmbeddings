# Test Status - Updated

## Current Status: 79/90 Tests Passing (87.8%)

### Just Fixed (Ready to Test)
- Added W&B disable flags to test environment
- Added tokenizers parallelism disable
- This should fix 4 additional test failures

---

## Expected After Running Tests Again

### Should Now Pass (4 tests):
- `test_lora_mode_creates_adapters` 
- `test_full_ft_mode_creates_checkpoint`
- `test_seq_ft_mode_continues_training`
- `test_train_all_buckets`

These were failing on W&B login, now disabled.

---

## Remaining Known Issues (5 tests)

### 1. Import Errors (2 tests)
**Tests:**
- `test_trainer_initialization`
- `test_train_tiny_batch`

**Error:** `ImportError: cannot import name 'LoRATrainer'`

**Fix needed:** Tests are trying to import a class name that doesn't exist in the code. Need to check actual class name in `trainer.py`.

### 2. CLI Help Test (1 test)
**Test:** `test_cli_help`

**Error:** `TypeError: Secondary flag is not valid for non-boolean flag`

**Status:** Non-critical. CLI works fine in practice, just help generation fails in tests.

### 3. Test Logic Issues (2 tests)

#### a) `test_preprocessing_pipeline`
**Error:** Expected 3 samples, got 1

**Cause:** Test data doesn't meet preprocessing length requirements (30-1000 chars)

#### b) `test_poor_ranking`
**Error:** Expected recall 0.5, got 1.0

**Cause:** Recall calculation or test expectation mismatch

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run tests again** to confirm W&B fix worked:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/run_tests.sh
   ```

2. **Expected outcome:** 83/90 tests passing (92%)

3. **If tests pass as expected**, address remaining 5 failures

---

## Progress Summary

**Solved issues:**
- FAISS segmentation faults (8 tests)
- Missing accelerate dependency (was blocking training)
- W&B initialization in tests (4 tests - pending verification)

**Remaining work:**
- Fix 2 import name issues
- Fix 2 test logic issues  
- Skip or fix 1 CLI help test (low priority)
